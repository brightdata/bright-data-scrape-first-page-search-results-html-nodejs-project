greater autonomy and help simplify your life at home and on the job. On the global stage, AI will help us find new ways to address some of the biggest challenges we face, from the climate crisis to healthcare access.  \n\n\n\nThis progress will be driven by advancements in AI’s ability to remember more and reason better, among other innovations. And Microsoft will remain grounded in its commitment to help people use and build AI that is safe and secure. \n\n\n\n“AI is already making the impossible feel possible, and over the past year we’ve seen significant numbers of people and organizations moving from AI experimentation to more meaningful adoption,” says Chris Young, executive vice president of business development, strategy and ventures at Microsoft. “This is the start of a full-scale transformation of how this technology will change every part of our lives.”  \n\n\n\nIn the last year alone, generative AI usage jumped from 55% to 75% among business leaders and AI decisionmakers. New AI tools will bring even more potential. \n\n\n\nWant to know what’s ahead? Here are six AI trends to watch — and how Microsoft will innovate on each — in 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI models will become more capable and useful \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nOver the past year, AI models became faster and more efficient. Today, large-scale “frontier models” can complete a broad range of tasks from writing to coding, and highly specialized models can be tailored for specific tasks or industries.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, models will do more — and do it even better.\n\n\n\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like OpenAI o1, can already solve complex problems with logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\n\n\n\nThese advancements will be important in model innovation, but so will progress in data curation and post-training. For example, Microsoft’s family of small Phi models showed that curating high-quality data can improve model performance and reasoning.\n\n\n\nAnd Microsoft’s Orca and Orca 2 showed the power of synthetic data for post-training small language models, getting these models to perform at levels previously found only in much larger language models and to perform better on specialized tasks.\n\n\n\nMaking models faster, better and more specialized will create new and more useful AI experiences, including with agents, in 2025.\n\n\n\n“There could be synergy between how we are training the models and how those models are powering agents in return,” says Ece Kamar, managing director of Microsoft’s AI Frontiers Lab. “And people will now have more opportunity than ever to choose from or build models that meet their needs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Agents will change the shape of work \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nWorkers at nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to tackle plenty of repetitive and mundane tasks, such as sifting through email and taking notes during Teams meetings. In 2025, a new generation of AI-powered agents will do more — even handling certain tasks on your behalf. \n\n\n\n“Think of agents as the apps of the AI era,” says Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot. “Just as we use different apps for various tasks, agents will begin to transform every business process, revolutionizing the way we work and manage our organizations.” \n\n\n\nWith advancements in memory, reasoning and multimodal capabilities, agents will handle more complex assignments with new skills and ways to interact.  \n\n\n\nOrganizations can reimagine processes like creating reports and human resources tasks such as helping resolve a new laptop issue or answering benefits questions, freeing employees to focus on higher value work. Businesses can set up multiple agents to alert supply chain managers about inventory disruptions, recommend new suppliers and execute sales orders, handling daily challenges to help keep sales coming in.  \n\n\n\nAnd you can build and use agents no matter your technical skill. Anyone can build an agent in Copilot Studio — no coding required — while developers can create more sophisticated agents to orchestrate more complex tasks in Azure AI Foundry. \n\n\n\nAll of this will lay the groundwork for a future when organizations have a constellation of agents — from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous — that will work independently or together on behalf of individuals, groups or functions to execute and orchestrate processes.  \n\n\n\nAmid all this AI development, human oversight will remain a central cog in the evolving AI-powered agent wheel, says Kamar. \n\n\n\n“In 2025, a lot of conversation will be about drawing the boundaries around what agents are allowed and not allowed to do, and always having human oversight,” Kamar says.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI companions will support you in your everyday life \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nOutside of work, AI is expected to make parts of your life easier in 2025. That’s because Microsoft Copilot can support you throughout your day as your AI companion. \n\n\n\nThis means it will help simplify and prioritize tasks like your daily barrage of information to free up more of your time, all while safeguarding your privacy, data and security. \n\n\n\nAs Copilot evolves over the next year, it will help you stay more connected and will have new capabilities.  \n\n\n\nCopilot Daily, for example, will start your day by reading you a summary of relevant news and weather in a familiar voice.  \n\n\n\nWhen you opt-in to use Copilot Vision, it will be able to see what you see online and talk with you about it because it will understand the web page you’re viewing, allowing it to answer your questions and suggest next steps.  \n\n\n\nCopilot will also help you make decisions. It could help you furnish your new apartment by searching for matching furniture and then help you think through the best way to arrange all of it to achieve feng shui. \n\n\n\nAnd that’s only the beginning. In the coming years, AI experiences will become increasingly accurate and gain better emotional intelligence for more fluid interactions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI will become more resource-efficient over time\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nWhile AI needs resources like energy, innovative solutions are helping with this challenge. Even as global datacenter workloads in 2020 were roughly nine times what they were in 2010, for example, datacenter electricity demand increased only 10%.  \n\n\n\nThat’s in part because Microsoft is working on its own and with others, like AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to make its hardware more efficient, from its custom silicon series, Azure Maia and Cobalt, to its liquid cooling heat exchanger unit designed to efficiently cool large-scale AI systems. \n\n\n\nIn the coming years, new datacenters that support AI will come online and consume zero water for cooling and the company will expand its use of superefficient liquid cooling systems such as cold plates. \n\n\n\nIt’s all part of a broader effort to make the infrastructure AI is built on more efficient and sustainable in 2025.  \n\n\n\nAs Microsoft helps build a more efficient AI infrastructure, it will continue to invest in and use more low-carbon building materials, like near-zero carbon steel, concrete alternatives and cross-laminated timber. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft will also keep investing in and using carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear and solar power. The company is making long-term investments to bring more carbon-free electricity onto the grids where it operates and continues to advocate for the expansion of clean energy solutions around the world. \n\n\n\nThis is only a slice of Microsoft’s planned infrastructure that will advance its goal to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030, says Mark Russinovich, Azure’s chief technology officer, deputy chief information security officer and technical fellow. \n\n\n\n“In 2025 and beyond we’re going to increasingly have a holistic view of datacenters, energy and resources, so that we can maximize the efficiency of our entire infrastructure,” Russinovich says.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Measurement and customization will be keys to building AI responsibly \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nMeasurement is defining and assessing risks in AI, and it’s critical for building AI responsibly. One of the biggest developments this coming year can be summarized in two words: testing and customization.  \n\n\n\nIf you can measure risks and threats, you can help address or mitigate both. This means, for example, detecting and addressing ungrounded content, known as “hallucinations,” which are inaccurate responses from AI. \n\n\n\nPart of Microsoft’s ongoing work to build safe AI applications is developing tough and comprehensive testing, says Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s chief product officer of Responsible AI. In addition to assessing internal threats like hallucinations, testing will become better at recognizing external and increasingly sophisticated attacks. \n\n\n\n“Even as models get safer, we need to bring testing and measurement up to the worst of the worst threats that we see — testing that represents a sophisticated adversarial user and what they’re able to do,” Bird says. “We have the foundation, and we’re going to continue to iterate on it moving forward.” \n\n\n\nPeople will also gain greater control over how AI applications operate within their organizations. They will be able to customize applications that filter content and establish guardrails that fit their work. A gaming company, for example, will be able to specify what kinds of violent content employees who are building games can see.  \n\n\n\n“The administrator can change the control of Microsoft 365 Copilot to say what types of content are appropriate in a workplace so people can do their jobs,” Bird says. “Control and customization are absolutely the future.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI will accelerate scientific breakthroughs \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nAI is already having a dramatic impact around the world, driving advances in everything from supercomputing to weather forecasting. It’s fueling historic breakthroughs in scientific research and promises to unlock new capabilities in the natural sciences, sustainable materials, drug discovery and human health.   \n\n\n\nIn 2024, for example, Microsoft Research made a breakthrough that will allow researchers to explore some of the world’s toughest biomolecular science problems, including the discovery of life-saving new drugs, with unprecedented speed and precision. Using an AI-driven protein simulation system, researchers found a new way to simulate biomolecular dynamics. This method, called AI2BMD, could help scientists solve previously intractable problems and fuel biomedical research in protein design, enzyme engineering and drug discovery.  \n\n\n\nAnd AI’s impact on science will continue to grow. \n\n\n\nOne of the most exciting things to watch in 2025 will be how AI’s use in scientific research fuels progress in addressing some of the world’s most pressing concerns, says Ashley Llorens, corporate vice president and managing director at Microsoft Research. \n\n\n\n“We’ll start to see these tools having a measurable impact on the throughput of the people and institutions who are working on these huge problems, such as designing sustainable materials and accelerating development of life-saving drugs,” Llorens says. \n\n\n\nIn 2025, one trend is certain: AI will continue to drive innovation and unlock new potential for people and organizations around the globe.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrations by Michał Bednarski / Makeshift Studios.

In return, they demand optimized performance, profitability and security.\n“This year it’s all about the customer,” said Kate Claassen, Head of Global Internet Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. “We're on the precipice of an entirely new technology foundation, where the best of the best is available to any business. The way companies will win is by bringing that to their customers holistically.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n              N/A\n\n            \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-suite executives from the biggest technology companies around the world gathered at the recent Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco, where they spoke about their efforts to build leading AI platforms and partner across the AI ecosystem. They also discussed their challenges, including unknowns regarding U.S. export bans and tariffs as well as constraints in power and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs). Five key themes emerged for executives and investors to watch:\n\n\nAI reasoning and custom silicon fuel demand for chips\nHyperscalers see cloud migrations and AI workloads as revenue opportunities\nLLMs see potential in AI reasoning for enterprises\nData companies zero in on evaluating AI\nSoftware companies set sights on agentic AI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. AI Reasoning and Custom Silicon Fuel Demand for Chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI reasoning is one of the biggest drivers of increasing compute demand, and thus semiconductors, said executives from companies that design and make chips. AI reasoning moves beyond basic understanding and into advanced learning and decision making, which requires additional compute for pre-training, post-training and inference.\nExecutives also highlighted that they are investing in capabilities to meet customer demand for tailored data-center architecture, in areas such as memory and power management, and custom silicon designed for particular AI tasks rather than general-purpose processing. Customers are debating whether to buy specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for specific uses; ASICs offer higher efficiency and performance compared to general-purpose GPUs, which offer greater flexibility and broad applications. ASICs demand may accelerate with increased adoption of edge AI on small devices in coming years, executives said.\n“For chip companies, customer demand is in the breadth of AI workloads for programmable infrastructure,” said Marco Lagos Morales, Head of U.S. Semiconductor Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. “What each customer wants in their data center builds is differing, and that means a much less prescriptive approach, starting with original equipment manufacturer designs.”\nExecutives also spoke about challenges to revenue growth, including continued foundry constraints due to the number of years needed to develop new construction sites and their physical limitations. They also underscored the unknown nature of U.S. export controls, with many saying they could not estimate the impact to their bottom lines until they know the criteria.\n\n\n\n    \n        Recent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem.\n        \n\n            \n\t\t\t\n            \n                \n                    \n                        Dave Chen\n                        Head of Global Technology Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Tweet this\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Share this on LinkedIn\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Share this on Facebook\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Email this\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Hyperscalers See Cloud Migrations and AI Workloads as Revenue Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperscalers, the cloud providers with the greatest computing, storage and networking resources, spoke about convincing enterprises to use as many services across their software stacks as possible, to create even bigger AI platforms with increasing market share.\nExecutives described robust capital expenditures on commercial cloud servers and expanding their AI offerings to improve AI reasoning, as well as creating specialized applications and progress toward agentic AI. They spoke about offsetting costs with customizable chips that optimize compute performance and targeting long-term utilization of their land and construction sites. They also addressed recent advancements in AI that improve computing efficiency as positive for their businesses, as it helps reduce costs and increase AI demand.\n“Recent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem,” said Dave Chen, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley, referring to the effect when increased efficiency leads to higher overall consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. LLMs See Potential in AI Reasoning for Enterprises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies that have developed the world’s biggest LLMs intend to use the most effective chips and build the best software to offer AI services that become essential for companies and consumers. While the early use cases for LLMs were content generation, summarization and classification, the biggest untapped potential is in AI reasoning for enterprise data, LLM executives said.\nEnterprises are currently using LLMs for customer support and chatbots, internal knowledge retrieval and search, content generation and marketing, coding automation and business intelligence. However, with AI reasoning, LLMs can help companies with context-aware recommendations, data insights, process optimizations, compliance and strategic planning. Executives spoke about expecting further accelerations in coding advancements. One estimated that the output of a single software engineer has already risen by 10 times or more. Among the earliest industries to fully harness tailored AI to do tenfold work may be biotechnology, for clinical trials and regulatory submissions, and law, for AI-powered paralegal work.\nMost enterprises want AI models that can ensure the security of their data, which is why some LLMs are researching and trying to commercialize mechanistic interpretability, which aims to understand why a model does what it does. This is important for all companies, but especially those in regulated industries such as financial services. “LLMs are competing to deliver the best inference stack to enterprises, which includes reasoning capabilities and strong AI governance,” said Brett Klein, Head of East Coast Technology Banking. “With sophisticated reasoning and adaptive learning, agentic AI will be able to make decisions and take actions to achieve business goals with minimal human intervention.”\nLLM executives also spoke about working with foundries to design and make custom silicon, to reduce the costs related to developing features such as recommender systems for ads or videos at scale. Many also said that recent AI advancements—such as continuous learning that enables adaptation based on recent interactions and updates without full retraining—are positive as software and apps proliferate, creating more real-world usage, data exposure and refined training opportunities.\n\n\n\n    \n        Writing code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business.” \n        \n\n            \n\t\t\t\n            \n                \n                    \n                        Enrique Perez-Hernandez\n                        Head of Global Technology Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    Tweet this\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Share this on LinkedIn\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Share this on Facebook\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Email this\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Data Companies Zero in on Evaluating AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies in the data and cloud infrastructure ecosystem are catering to enterprises by building tools that can help them automate observability—the ability to understand a system’s behavior by analyzing the data it generates—and creating evaluation systems for their AI uses, to help customers drive ROI.\n“Writing code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business,” said Enrique Perez-Hernandez, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. “Data companies are building AI engines more focused on helping companies understand whether LLMs are working properly and doing the right thing for the business.”\nSome data companies are partnering with LLMs to power frontier models that allow users without a business-intelligence background to derive insights. Executives spoke about the importance of building custom AI tools, such as chat interfaces, that can parse through entities’ structured and unstructured data, whether they are enterprises in regulated industries or countries where data must remain on premises.\nExecutives also highlighted the “data lakehouse revolution”—a trend to create unified data platforms that combine data lakes’ low-cost storage and flexibility with data warehouses’ structure and management features. This may involve partnerships with big corporations and other large tech companies in the AI ecosystem, to create best-of-breed AI and machine learning services for cloud integrations, cybersecurity, analytics, data sharing and industry-specific solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Software Companies Set Sights on Agentic AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware executives spoke about their current use of AI for productivity gains in marketing and engineering and their longer-term prospects to gain market share in an agentic computing future. These companies are aiming to create large systems that deploy AI agents to make decisions, take autonomous actions and adapt to changing environments for real-world applications across industries.\nExecutives spoke about how next-gen technology is shifting toward personalized content and shopping experiences, taking form as assistants that are intimately familiar with users’ interests and queries. Many also warned against an agentic AI hype cycle, underscoring that investors shouldn’t expect profitability in the next three to five years.\n“Software companies are vying to create larger operating systems that harness machine learning, LLMs, natural language processing, generative AI and decision-making algorithms to move toward an agentic future,” said Brittany Skoda, Global Head of Software Banking. “Eventually, such systems could prove to be incredibly valuable to consumers, creators and advertisers and across enterprises,” said Melissa Knox, Global Head of Software Banking.\n\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n        \n            Discover More Investment Banking Insights\n            \n                \n                    Read More\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n       \n       \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    More Stories\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\n\n\t\n \t\n\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                \n                \n\t\t\n    \n    \n\t\n\tInvestment Banking\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t2025 Capital Markets Outlook: 3 Trends Fueling a Resurgence\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n\t\t \n            Feb 18, 2025\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tFavorable economic conditions have set up a potential rebound in M&A, private credit assets could reach $2.8 trillion and corporate spending on AI is poised to grow.\n\t\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\n\n\t\n \t\n\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                \n                \n\t\t\n    \n    \n\t\n\tInvestment Banking\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t3 European Tech and Telecom Trends for 2025\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n\t\t \n            Jan 29, 2025\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tAI demand, M&A-friendly policy and investments in innovation could drive growth in Europe’s technology and telecommunications sectors.\n\t\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\n\n\t\n \t\n\n\n                            \n\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                \n                \n\t\t\n    \n    \n\t\n\tInvestment Banking\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t2025 M&A Outlook: 4 Trends Driving an Anticipated Rebound\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n\t\t \n            Jan 14, 2025\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tA favorable regulatory environment and almost $3 trillion in uncommitted capital are among key factors that could lead to a comeback for mergers and acquisitions.\n\t\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n   \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Disclosures\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Investor Relations\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Corporate Governance\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Newsroom\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Careers\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Contact Us\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Global Offices\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Equal Employment Opportunity\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Cybersecurity\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Terms of Use\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Privacy & Cookies\n\n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n    Your Privacy Choices\n\n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        © 2025 Morgan Stanley.
