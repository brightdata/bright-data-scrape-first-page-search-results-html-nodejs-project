Lael Brainard.\n    \n\n    \n            The central bank will keep interest rates near zero and continue its asset purchases for as long as needed, Brainard said at a lecture at the Canadian Association for Business Economics.\n    \n\n    \n            And for those concerned about spikes in inflation, there was some soothing data earlier today: Inflation was only 1.4% last year, giving the Fed ample wriggle room, especially under its new policy framework that allows a little more inflation than the old one. This should rule out any rate hikes in the near term. \n    \n\n\n            \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    The new policy approach, by avoiding the need to tighten preemptively, could support labor market conditions that help to reduce persistent disparities,” Brainard said. “This could, in turn, boost activity and increase potential growth by drawing individuals from groups facing structural challenges into more productive employment.”\n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n            “Lifting the lives of working people is at the heart of economic policymaking,” she added.\n    \n\n    \n            But the Fed can’t go it alone, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said many times.

Buzzy online lending startup Affirm, which lets people buy now and pay later for goods, soared about 90% in its market debut Wednesday.\n    \n\n    \n            Affirm (AFRM), whose CEO and founder is PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Max Levchin, sold $1.2 billion in the stock offering and is now worth more than $22.5 billion. The surge for Affirm follows the big jumps for Airbnb (ABNB), DoorDash (DASH) and Palantir (PLTR) when they began trading late last year.\n    \n\n    \n            The company, like many startups, is growing rapidly. Sales in its latest fiscal year nearly doubled to more than $500 million. But like most unicorns, Affirm is not yet profitable. \n    \n\n    \n            Still, the successful IPO is the latest feather in the caps of the so-called PayPal mafia, former executives at the digital payments giant who went on to even bigger things in the world of tech and finance.\n    \n\n    \n            That list includes venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a Palantir co-founder and one of the few high-profile Republican/Trump donors in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Yelp (YELP) CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman and YouTube co-founders Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. \n    \n\n    \n            And oh yeah, some guy named Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, was part of that group, too. \n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            No letting up for jobless claims\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            Tomorrow is jobless claims day, and the data is unlikely to show signs of improvement. \n    \n\n    \n            Economists polled by Refinitiv expect that another 780,000 Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week. That would only be 7,000 fewer than in the prior week. Ugh.\n    \n\n    \n            Weekly first-time jobless claims haven’t shown improvement for weeks. After dropping below 1 million in late August, they have stayed in a tight range for an economy that’s meant to be recovering.\n    \n\n    \n            Worse still, these numbers don’t include claims from workers such as the self-employed who filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which are counted separately.\n    \n\n    \n            There’s no letting up for America’s jobs crisis. The last stimulus package has extended the pandemic-specific benefits introduced in the CARES Act and added a weekly $300 to regular aid. But more will likely need to be done once President-elect Joe Biden takes office next week.\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Stocks are mixed at midday\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            Tech stocks are among the winners today, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4% at midday.\n    \n\n    \n            But it doesn’t look that cheery across the other indexes.

In fact, that was the smallest December-to-December price increase since 2015.\n    \n\n    \n            Without food and energy, inflation was 1.6% last year. The index of food prices alone rose 3.9% (remember how everything got more expensive at the grocery store?), while the energy index dropped 7% (the collapse in oil brought gas prices down, even though they rose again at the end of the year).\n    \n\n    \n            In December alone prices rose 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was in line with expectations.

Bond yields and prices move opposite to each other, so when the price goes up, the yield goes down.\n    \n\n    \n            After a rocky March, yields remained tepid, and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep interest rates near zero to support the economy helped with that.\n    \n\n    \n            But since the start to the new year, yields have been on the rise, climbing above 1% for the first time last week. Until today. \n    \n\n    \n            Market watchers think the pause is due to investors being reminded that the Fed isn’t going to raise rates anytime soon after some sobering words from the central bank’s officials yesterday.
