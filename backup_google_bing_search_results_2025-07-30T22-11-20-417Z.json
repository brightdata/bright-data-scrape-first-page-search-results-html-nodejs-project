Lael Brainard.\n    \n\n    \n            The central bank will keep interest rates near zero and continue its asset purchases for as long as needed, Brainard said at a lecture at the Canadian Association for Business Economics.\n    \n\n    \n            And for those concerned about spikes in inflation, there was some soothing data earlier today: Inflation was only 1.4% last year, giving the Fed ample wriggle room, especially under its new policy framework that allows a little more inflation than the old one. This should rule out any rate hikes in the near term. \n    \n\n\n            \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    The new policy approach, by avoiding the need to tighten preemptively, could support labor market conditions that help to reduce persistent disparities,” Brainard said. “This could, in turn, boost activity and increase potential growth by drawing individuals from groups facing structural challenges into more productive employment.”\n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n            “Lifting the lives of working people is at the heart of economic policymaking,” she added.\n    \n\n    \n            But the Fed can’t go it alone, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said many times.

Buzzy online lending startup Affirm, which lets people buy now and pay later for goods, soared about 90% in its market debut Wednesday.\n    \n\n    \n            Affirm (AFRM), whose CEO and founder is PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Max Levchin, sold $1.2 billion in the stock offering and is now worth more than $22.5 billion. The surge for Affirm follows the big jumps for Airbnb (ABNB), DoorDash (DASH) and Palantir (PLTR) when they began trading late last year.\n    \n\n    \n            The company, like many startups, is growing rapidly. Sales in its latest fiscal year nearly doubled to more than $500 million. But like most unicorns, Affirm is not yet profitable. \n    \n\n    \n            Still, the successful IPO is the latest feather in the caps of the so-called PayPal mafia, former executives at the digital payments giant who went on to even bigger things in the world of tech and finance.\n    \n\n    \n            That list includes venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a Palantir co-founder and one of the few high-profile Republican/Trump donors in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Yelp (YELP) CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman and YouTube co-founders Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. \n    \n\n    \n            And oh yeah, some guy named Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, was part of that group, too. \n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            No letting up for jobless claims\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            Tomorrow is jobless claims day, and the data is unlikely to show signs of improvement. \n    \n\n    \n            Economists polled by Refinitiv expect that another 780,000 Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week. That would only be 7,000 fewer than in the prior week. Ugh.\n    \n\n    \n            Weekly first-time jobless claims haven’t shown improvement for weeks. After dropping below 1 million in late August, they have stayed in a tight range for an economy that’s meant to be recovering.\n    \n\n    \n            Worse still, these numbers don’t include claims from workers such as the self-employed who filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which are counted separately.\n    \n\n    \n            There’s no letting up for America’s jobs crisis. The last stimulus package has extended the pandemic-specific benefits introduced in the CARES Act and added a weekly $300 to regular aid. But more will likely need to be done once President-elect Joe Biden takes office next week.\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Stocks are mixed at midday\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            Tech stocks are among the winners today, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4% at midday.\n    \n\n    \n            But it doesn’t look that cheery across the other indexes.

In fact, that was the smallest December-to-December price increase since 2015.\n    \n\n    \n            Without food and energy, inflation was 1.6% last year. The index of food prices alone rose 3.9% (remember how everything got more expensive at the grocery store?), while the energy index dropped 7% (the collapse in oil brought gas prices down, even though they rose again at the end of the year).\n    \n\n    \n            In December alone prices rose 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was in line with expectations.

Bond yields and prices move opposite to each other, so when the price goes up, the yield goes down.\n    \n\n    \n            After a rocky March, yields remained tepid, and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep interest rates near zero to support the economy helped with that.\n    \n\n    \n            But since the start to the new year, yields have been on the rise, climbing above 1% for the first time last week. Until today. \n    \n\n    \n            Market watchers think the pause is due to investors being reminded that the Fed isn’t going to raise rates anytime soon after some sobering words from the central bank’s officials yesterday.

His answer: We’re not really worried about that right now.\n    \n\n    \n            “The problem now is that demand is very strong, incomes are high, people have money in the bank  accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t come down,” Powell said. “But in terms of overcorrecting, there is a possibility on the other side of this that inflation could actually be quite low going forward. But that is not where our focus is right now.”\n    \n\n    \n            Powell said there’s no reason to expect prices will remain high for a long time — if prices keep soaring for travel, people will build new hotels, for example. But the timing of when prices come back in check remains uncertain, he said. \n    \n\n    \n            “We don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that this goes on longer than expected and the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations,” Powell said. “If we see inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that. We do not expect that though.”\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Everybody calm the hell down\n                \n                    From CNN Business' David Goldman\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            When the Federal Reserve Chairman is calling Wednesday’s meeting “the talking about talking about it meeting,” you know he’s trying to give a pacifier to Wall Street investors. \n    \n\n    \n            Investors weren’t exactly buying the baby talk. Stocks were down a bunch, although not as bad as you’d think after the Fed finally predicted higher rates in the future. \n    \n\n    \n            Still, Powell did everything he could not to be a wet blanket by saying that any rate increases are coming in the far, distant future (as in 2023, or maybe next year).\n    \n\n\n            \n\n        \n            \n                \n                    “Lift off is well into the future — the conditions for liftoff are far from maximum employment for example — it is a consideration for the future,” Powell said. “The near term thing is, that we learn from discussion that we will begin, is really about the path of asset purchases.  As I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today.  And we expect to in future meetings continue to think about our progress.”\n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            What's driving prices higher?\n                \n                    From CNN Business' David Goldman\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            It’s the economy, stupid.\n    \n\n    \n            The stock market might be freaking out about inflation today, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell isn’t. It’s a normal function of the economic rebound, he says, and the data backs him up.\n    \n\n    \n            “If you look behind the headline numbers, the incoming data are consistent with the view that the prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery — from the pandemic and reopening of the economy,” Powell said. \n    \n\n    \n            He noted that lumber prices spiked because of bottlenecks but have come back down, as expected. That’s true of other categories, with the notable exception of used cars — which are accounting for one third of inflation.

Investors had been mostly complacent, even as multiple inflation reports showed prices were rising more than expected. Still, investors expected the Fed to largely stay the course and keep rates near rock-bottom.\n    \n\n    \n            To Wall Street’s credit, that’s pretty much what the Fed did.

And it’s well above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n    \n\n    \n            However, the Fed is still signaling confidence this burst of inflation will pass. The median Fed official expects inflation to ease to just 2.1% in 2022, up just slightly from the March projection. Forecasts for 2023 inflation barely budged higher.\n    \n\n    \n            In its policy statement, the Fed again noted that “inflation has risen,” but stressed this “largely” reflects transitory factors.\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Fed expects to raise rates sooner than you'd think\n                \n                    From CNN Business' David Goldman\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            The Federal Reserve expects to raise rates in 2023, far sooner than it previously believed as inflation continues to spike.\n    \n\n    \n            In its so-called dot-plot of predictions, Fed governors expect that the federal funds rate, which is currently near zero, will rise to about 0.6% by 2023. In the previous dot-plot in March, the Fed projected it wouldn’t raise rates until 2024 at the earliest.\n    \n\n    \n            Forcing the Fed’s hand is a combination of a stronger economy and rising inflation. The Fed sharply boosted its estimates for both – predicting a 7% rise in America’s gross domestic product this year, up from its previous estimate of 6.5%. But it also expects prices to grow 3.4% this year, up from 2.4% in its prior estimate.\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Fed could change rate hike forecast: strategist\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n      \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n  \n  \n\n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            It’s just under an hour until the Federal Reserve publishes its latest monetary policy update.

One answer: they may be starting their own business. \n    \n\n    \n             Americans in 2021 are starting businesses are a record rate. As of May, 2.5 million new business applications have been filed for this year alone, not adjusted for seasonal swings, according to the Census Bureau. In just 5 months, that’s already more than half of the businesses formed in 2020 – a banner year for growth. Americans started 4.4 million new businesses in 2020, a stunning 24% jump from the year before and the biggest increase on record. \n    \n\n    \n            Some of these entrepreneurs lost jobs during the pandemic, according to a report by Peterson Institute for International Economics looking at the unprecedented business formation. \n    \n\n    \n            “Higher local unemployment rates predict increases in U.S. entrepreneurship during past downturns,” the report said. “The more limited opportunities in the wage sector may have incentivized entrepreneurship by necessity.” \n    \n\n    \n            Others likely took advantage of the billions in government stimulus for both U.S. households and businesses. Even though no direct legislation directly supported new business formation, a May study looking at data at the state level found that the implementation of relief packages directly boosted start-up formation rates. \n    \n\n    \n            Many Americans starting these businesses also likely saw a niche to fill during the pandemic. According to the Census data, some of the strongest growth has been in sectors like retail, transportation and warehousing, construction, and real estate. \n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Janet Yellen: No one wants to return to 1970s-style inflation spiral\n                \n                    From CNN Business'  Matt Egan\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the Biden administration is not dismissing the resurgence of inflation as the US economy reopens from the pandemic.\n    \n\n    \n            “We’re monitoring inflation very carefully and do take it very seriously,” Yellen said during a Senate hearing on the Biden budget. “No one wants to return to the bad high inflation days of the ’70s.”\n    \n\n    \n            Yellen was responding to criticism from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who said he’s very troubled by the Treasury secretary’s “nonchalant” approach to inflation.\n    \n\n    \n            “As we know from the 1970s, once inflation takes off, getting it back under control can require very painful measures,” Grassley said. “The early 1980s proved that.”\n    \n\n    \n            The Volcker-led Fed was able to tame inflation only by raising interest rates so aggressively that it tanked the US economy. \n    \n\n    \n            Yellen stressed that prices should cool off soon.\n    \n\n    \n            “The current burst of inflation we’re seeing reflects the difficulty of reopening an economy that’s been shut down, seeing huge swings in spending patterns and is experiencing bottlenecks,” Yellen said. \n    \n\n    \n            She added that the Biden administration is taking steps to deal with bottlenecks and defended the president’s budget as “fiscally responsible.”\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Stocks inch higher\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                        \n            US stocks were modestly higher early Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy update. \n    \n\n    \n            Investors will focus on whether the central bank will change its tone on inflation after recent reports on key price indexes showed that inflationary pressures are alive and well.\n    \n\n  \n  \n      \n      \n        \n            The Dow opened 0.1%, or 22 points, higher.\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n            The S&P 500 also rose 0.1%.\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n            The Nasdaq Composite opened up 0.1%.\n        \n      \n  \n\n\n    \n            A few minutes into the trading day, only the Nasdaq remains in the green, with the other two indexes having pared their gains.\n    \n\n            \n        \n              \n    \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n                \n\n        \n        \n            \n\n            Link Copied!\n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n              \n\n            \n        \n                \n            Housing starts and building permits fell short of expectations in May\n                \n                    From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe\n                \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n      \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n  \n  \n  \n\n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            In this morning’s economic data, housing starts and building permits for May fell just short of analyst expectations.\n    \n\n    \n            Building permits came in at 1.7 million, about 50,000 below the consensus.

greater autonomy and help simplify your life at home and on the job. On the global stage, AI will help us find new ways to address some of the biggest challenges we face, from the climate crisis to healthcare access.  \n\n\n\nThis progress will be driven by advancements in AI’s ability to remember more and reason better, among other innovations. And Microsoft will remain grounded in its commitment to help people use and build AI that is safe and secure. \n\n\n\n“AI is already making the impossible feel possible, and over the past year we’ve seen significant numbers of people and organizations moving from AI experimentation to more meaningful adoption,” says Chris Young, executive vice president of business development, strategy and ventures at Microsoft. “This is the start of a full-scale transformation of how this technology will change every part of our lives.”  \n\n\n\nIn the last year alone, generative AI usage jumped from 55% to 75% among business leaders and AI decisionmakers. New AI tools will bring even more potential. \n\n\n\nWant to know what’s ahead? Here are six AI trends to watch — and how Microsoft will innovate on each — in 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI models will become more capable and useful \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nOver the past year, AI models became faster and more efficient. Today, large-scale “frontier models” can complete a broad range of tasks from writing to coding, and highly specialized models can be tailored for specific tasks or industries.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, models will do more — and do it even better.\n\n\n\nModels with advanced reasoning capabilities, like OpenAI o1, can already solve complex problems with logical steps that are similar to how humans think before responding to difficult questions. These capabilities will continue to be useful in fields like science, coding, math, law and medicine, allowing models to compare contracts, generate code and execute multistep workflows.\n\n\n\nThese advancements will be important in model innovation, but so will progress in data curation and post-training. For example, Microsoft’s family of small Phi models showed that curating high-quality data can improve model performance and reasoning.\n\n\n\nAnd Microsoft’s Orca and Orca 2 showed the power of synthetic data for post-training small language models, getting these models to perform at levels previously found only in much larger language models and to perform better on specialized tasks.\n\n\n\nMaking models faster, better and more specialized will create new and more useful AI experiences, including with agents, in 2025.\n\n\n\n“There could be synergy between how we are training the models and how those models are powering agents in return,” says Ece Kamar, managing director of Microsoft’s AI Frontiers Lab. “And people will now have more opportunity than ever to choose from or build models that meet their needs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Agents will change the shape of work \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nWorkers at nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies already use Microsoft 365 Copilot to tackle plenty of repetitive and mundane tasks, such as sifting through email and taking notes during Teams meetings. In 2025, a new generation of AI-powered agents will do more — even handling certain tasks on your behalf. \n\n\n\n“Think of agents as the apps of the AI era,” says Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot. “Just as we use different apps for various tasks, agents will begin to transform every business process, revolutionizing the way we work and manage our organizations.” \n\n\n\nWith advancements in memory, reasoning and multimodal capabilities, agents will handle more complex assignments with new skills and ways to interact.  \n\n\n\nOrganizations can reimagine processes like creating reports and human resources tasks such as helping resolve a new laptop issue or answering benefits questions, freeing employees to focus on higher value work. Businesses can set up multiple agents to alert supply chain managers about inventory disruptions, recommend new suppliers and execute sales orders, handling daily challenges to help keep sales coming in.  \n\n\n\nAnd you can build and use agents no matter your technical skill. Anyone can build an agent in Copilot Studio — no coding required — while developers can create more sophisticated agents to orchestrate more complex tasks in Azure AI Foundry. \n\n\n\nAll of this will lay the groundwork for a future when organizations have a constellation of agents — from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous — that will work independently or together on behalf of individuals, groups or functions to execute and orchestrate processes.  \n\n\n\nAmid all this AI development, human oversight will remain a central cog in the evolving AI-powered agent wheel, says Kamar. \n\n\n\n“In 2025, a lot of conversation will be about drawing the boundaries around what agents are allowed and not allowed to do, and always having human oversight,” Kamar says.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI companions will support you in your everyday life \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nOutside of work, AI is expected to make parts of your life easier in 2025. That’s because Microsoft Copilot can support you throughout your day as your AI companion. \n\n\n\nThis means it will help simplify and prioritize tasks like your daily barrage of information to free up more of your time, all while safeguarding your privacy, data and security. \n\n\n\nAs Copilot evolves over the next year, it will help you stay more connected and will have new capabilities.  \n\n\n\nCopilot Daily, for example, will start your day by reading you a summary of relevant news and weather in a familiar voice.  \n\n\n\nWhen you opt-in to use Copilot Vision, it will be able to see what you see online and talk with you about it because it will understand the web page you’re viewing, allowing it to answer your questions and suggest next steps.  \n\n\n\nCopilot will also help you make decisions. It could help you furnish your new apartment by searching for matching furniture and then help you think through the best way to arrange all of it to achieve feng shui. \n\n\n\nAnd that’s only the beginning. In the coming years, AI experiences will become increasingly accurate and gain better emotional intelligence for more fluid interactions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI will become more resource-efficient over time\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nWhile AI needs resources like energy, innovative solutions are helping with this challenge. Even as global datacenter workloads in 2020 were roughly nine times what they were in 2010, for example, datacenter electricity demand increased only 10%.  \n\n\n\nThat’s in part because Microsoft is working on its own and with others, like AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to make its hardware more efficient, from its custom silicon series, Azure Maia and Cobalt, to its liquid cooling heat exchanger unit designed to efficiently cool large-scale AI systems. \n\n\n\nIn the coming years, new datacenters that support AI will come online and consume zero water for cooling and the company will expand its use of superefficient liquid cooling systems such as cold plates. \n\n\n\nIt’s all part of a broader effort to make the infrastructure AI is built on more efficient and sustainable in 2025.  \n\n\n\nAs Microsoft helps build a more efficient AI infrastructure, it will continue to invest in and use more low-carbon building materials, like near-zero carbon steel, concrete alternatives and cross-laminated timber. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft will also keep investing in and using carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear and solar power. The company is making long-term investments to bring more carbon-free electricity onto the grids where it operates and continues to advocate for the expansion of clean energy solutions around the world. \n\n\n\nThis is only a slice of Microsoft’s planned infrastructure that will advance its goal to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030, says Mark Russinovich, Azure’s chief technology officer, deputy chief information security officer and technical fellow. \n\n\n\n“In 2025 and beyond we’re going to increasingly have a holistic view of datacenters, energy and resources, so that we can maximize the efficiency of our entire infrastructure,” Russinovich says.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Measurement and customization will be keys to building AI responsibly \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nMeasurement is defining and assessing risks in AI, and it’s critical for building AI responsibly. One of the biggest developments this coming year can be summarized in two words: testing and customization.  \n\n\n\nIf you can measure risks and threats, you can help address or mitigate both. This means, for example, detecting and addressing ungrounded content, known as “hallucinations,” which are inaccurate responses from AI. \n\n\n\nPart of Microsoft’s ongoing work to build safe AI applications is developing tough and comprehensive testing, says Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s chief product officer of Responsible AI. In addition to assessing internal threats like hallucinations, testing will become better at recognizing external and increasingly sophisticated attacks. \n\n\n\n“Even as models get safer, we need to bring testing and measurement up to the worst of the worst threats that we see — testing that represents a sophisticated adversarial user and what they’re able to do,” Bird says. “We have the foundation, and we’re going to continue to iterate on it moving forward.” \n\n\n\nPeople will also gain greater control over how AI applications operate within their organizations. They will be able to customize applications that filter content and establish guardrails that fit their work. A gaming company, for example, will be able to specify what kinds of violent content employees who are building games can see.  \n\n\n\n“The administrator can change the control of Microsoft 365 Copilot to say what types of content are appropriate in a workplace so people can do their jobs,” Bird says. “Control and customization are absolutely the future.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                             \n                                \n                                                        \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n        \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            AI will accelerate scientific breakthroughs \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                        \n\n                                            \n                \n\n \n                \n            \n        \n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nAI is already having a dramatic impact around the world, driving advances in everything from supercomputing to weather forecasting. It’s fueling historic breakthroughs in scientific research and promises to unlock new capabilities in the natural sciences, sustainable materials, drug discovery and human health.   \n\n\n\nIn 2024, for example, Microsoft Research made a breakthrough that will allow researchers to explore some of the world’s toughest biomolecular science problems, including the discovery of life-saving new drugs, with unprecedented speed and precision. Using an AI-driven protein simulation system, researchers found a new way to simulate biomolecular dynamics. This method, called AI2BMD, could help scientists solve previously intractable problems and fuel biomedical research in protein design, enzyme engineering and drug discovery.  \n\n\n\nAnd AI’s impact on science will continue to grow. \n\n\n\nOne of the most exciting things to watch in 2025 will be how AI’s use in scientific research fuels progress in addressing some of the world’s most pressing concerns, says Ashley Llorens, corporate vice president and managing director at Microsoft Research. \n\n\n\n“We’ll start to see these tools having a measurable impact on the throughput of the people and institutions who are working on these huge problems, such as designing sustainable materials and accelerating development of life-saving drugs,” Llorens says. \n\n\n\nIn 2025, one trend is certain: AI will continue to drive innovation and unlock new potential for people and organizations around the globe.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrations by Michał Bednarski / Makeshift Studios.

Our annual tech trends report highlights the latest technology breakthroughs, talent trends, use cases, and their potential impact on companies across sectors.McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 (108 pages)\nThe global technology landscape is undergoing significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving innovations in technologies. These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.\nThis year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s dozen”—frontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur.   The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)\nResearch methodologyTo assess the development of each of the 13 technology trends highlighted in this report, we collected data on six tangible measures of activity: search engine queries, news articles, patents, research publications, equity investment, and talent demand. For each measure or vector, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of keywords associated with each of the trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale relative to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment measures the flows of funding from the capital markets to companies linked with the trend. Data sources for the scores include the following:\n\n    Patents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents, which highlights data on the number of patents granted.\n    Research. Data on research publications are sourced from The Lens.\n    News. Data on news articles are sourced from Factiva.\n    Searches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.\n    Equity investment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises across venture capital and corporate and strategic M&A, including joint ventures; private equity investments, including buyouts and private investment in public equity; and public investments, including IPOs, are sourced from PitchBook. Investment data excludes corporate capital and operational expenditures.\n    Talent demand. The number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on publicly available professional profiles and job postings. Data are drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.\n\nIn addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s report to reflect the evolution of technology trends:\n\n    An overarching artificial intelligence category replaces these four trends: applied AI, generative AI, industrializing machine learning, and next-generation software development.\n    The agentic AI and application-specific semiconductors trends have been added since last year’s publication.\n    Two separate trends from last year, electrification and renewables and climate technologies beyond electrification, have been combined into a single trend: future of energy and sustainability technologies.\n\nThe data sources and keywords have been updated. For equity investment insights into the future of space technologies and quantum technologies, we built on research from McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice and the Quantum Technology Monitor.\nInsights gathered from McKinsey expert interviews were utilized to assign enterprise-wide adoption scores (on a 1–5 scale) for each trend, defined as follows:\n\n    1—Frontier innovation. This technology is still nascent, and few organizations are investing in or applying it. It is largely unproven in a business context.\n    2—Experimentation. Organizations are testing the functionality and viability of the technology with small-scale prototypes, typically without a focus on a near-term ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully scaled the technology.\n    3—Piloting. Organizations are deploying the technology in the first few business use cases, via pilot projects or limited implementation, to test its feasibility and effectiveness.\n    4—Scaling in progress. Organizations are scaling the deployment and adoption of the technology across the enterprise.\n    \n    5—Fully scaled. Organizations have fully deployed and integrated the technology across the enterprise. It has become the standard and is being used at a large scale as companies have recognized the value and benefits of the technology.\n\nThis outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and  unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.\nThe Future of Business: 13 technology trends that matterTuesday, July 29th\n10:30 - 11:00 a.m. EDT / 4:30 - 5:00 p.m. CEST\nJoin McKinsey’s Lareina Yee, Michael Chui, and Roger Roberts as they share our latest research on how leaders can capture value from the 13 technology trends that are potentially reshaping industries and creating new growth opportunities. They’ll explore how AI is powering innovation across industries, how technologies like agentic AI and autonomous systems are gaining momentum, and what leaders can do to stay ahead.Register here\nEven as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.\n\nNew and notable\nIn addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is agentic AI, which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.\n\nAI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While Moore’s Law and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption.     This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.\nTechnology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.\nFrom the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year’s technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:\n\n    The rise of autonomous systems.  Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren’t just executing tasks; they’re starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.\n    New human–machine collaboration models. Human–machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative from human replacement to augmentation—enabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.\n    Scaling challenges. The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands  have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.\n    Regional and national competition. Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.\n    Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously. Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while  on the other, we observe accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.\n    Responsible innovation imperatives. As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment   that can accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and long-term impact.\n\nThe following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:\n\nAfter a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).\n\nOur baker’s dozen   of technology trends shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential of emerging technologies and the need for strategic alignment in an AI-powered future. For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today’s emerging frontier technologies.\nLareina Yee is a McKinsey Global Institute director and a senior partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, where Michael Chui is a senior fellow at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and Roger Roberts is a partner at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey; Sven Smit is chair of the McKinsey Global Institute and a senior partner in the Amsterdam office.\nThe authors wish to thank the following McKinsey colleagues and alumni for their contributions to this research: Aamer Baig, Ahsan Saeed, Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Alex Zhang, Alizee Acket-Goemaere, Amishi Bharti, Amy Silverstein, Andrea Del Miglio, Andreas Breiter, Andreas Schlosser, Ani Kelkar, Anna Heid, Anu Madgavkar, Arjita Bhan, Bernd Heid, Bharath Aiyer, Bill Gregg, Bill Wiseman, Brooke Stokes, Bryan Richardson, Charlie Lewis, Christian Staudt, Clint Wood, Daniel Herde, Daniel Wallance, David Naney, Delphine Nain Zurkiya, Diana Tang, Egor Kiselev, Eliza Spinna, Emily Shao, Erika Stanzl, Fabian Queder, Gabriel Morgan Asaftei, Giacomo Gatto, Godart van Gendt, Hamza Khan, Henning Soller, Ichiro Otobe, Jacob Achenbach, Jakob Fleischmann, Jawad Mourabet, Jeffrey Caso, Jenny Tran, Jesse Noffsinger, Jim Adams, Jim Boehm, Jonathan Tilley, Joshua Katz, Justin Greis, Karl Grosselin, Kersten Heineke, Kevin F.
